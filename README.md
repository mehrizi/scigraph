I see people specialized in different fields but they usually lack a big picture or at least they don\'t know how, where and "when" their specialty is located in the field or in general knowledge.

Some examples:

1. I see freudian psychoanalysts who have strong sence about their method, but they totally lack a picture of all therapeutic methods, and how psychoanalysis is compared to them.

2. I encounter couragous programmers focused on some stack, lets say ES6&React&Tailwind. But He lacks algorithmic knwoledge and know little of OOP. He is a guru in React implementation and can pracatically build evrything with his expertise.

3. A Born christian, who goes to the church on sunday every week. He believes in God and follows common moralities of the church. He never studied other religions but he is peaceful with himself.

These examples demonstrate people very expert and believers in their niche but very unawair where their knowledge/underestanding is placed in the field. This can be very dangerous or at least very costly!

## Why does it matter?
While my debate here is mostly subjective and basically arose from repetitive experience I think objective study of the matter would confirm my findings as repetition of my experiences matters!

My statement would say:

> Every human (neural network based entity), practicing a subject, should gather information and knowledge about the subject placement in general otherwise it would cost the system at one point!

In case of any of the examples let me explain how I see the sitatuion can be dangerous:

1. The patient is suffering from loosing his son at age of 15. She asks for help by visiting the psychoanalyst. She is suffering from depression and very low mood. Psychoanalysts asks her small questions and some nodding and containing... 
She commits suicide the other day


I would like to start with how knoledge is formed and percieved by our nervous system and brain
