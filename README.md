# Weighting
Every Node/Edge has a size attribute that is caclulated as a sum of the following attributes:
- Parent Relationship size
- Sum size of books
- 
## Book Weight
Each book has the following attributes and size of a book is the multiplication of the following attributes:

- Copy count
- Book Grade (Written for public: 1, Specialized: 2)
- Writer Grade (Noble Winner:2, Other writers: 1)

Books on edge of two nodes are listed for both nodes but will contribute 50% increase in size for each node.

# Positioning
The idea is to minimize the total lenght of all edges in the graph without having overlaps of nodes!


# Phylosophy
I see people specialized in different fields but they usually lack a big picture or at least they don\'t know how, where and "when" their specialty is located in the field or in general knowledge.

Some examples:

1. I see freudian psychoanalysts who have strong sence about their method, but they totally lack a picture of all therapeutic methods, and how psychoanalysis is compared to them.

2. I encounter couragous programmers focused on some stack, lets say ES6&React&Tailwind. But He lacks algorithmic knwoledge and know little of OOP. He is a guru in React implementation and can pracatically build evrything with his expertise.

3. A Born christian, who goes to the church on sunday every week. He believes in God and follows common moralities of the church. He never studied other religions but he is peaceful with himself.

These examples demonstrate people very expert and believers in their niche but very unawair where their knowledge/underestanding is placed in the field. This can be very dangerous or at least very costly!

## Why does it matter?
While my debate here is mostly subjective and basically arose from repetitive experience and ofcourse some cognitive thinking and studying. I think objective study of the matter would confirm my findings as _repetition_ of my experiences matters!

My statement would say:

> Every human (neural network based entity), practicing a subject, should gather information and knowledge about the subject placement in general otherwise it would cost the system at one point!

In case of any of the examples let me explain how I saw the sitatuion went/can be dangerous:

1. The patient is suffering from loosing his son at age of 15. She asks for help by visiting the psychoanalyst. She is suffering from depression and very low mood. Psychoanalysts asks her small questions and some nodding and containing... 
She commits suicide the other day

2. 

3.

As Some Objective studies like "Why Nations Fail" by nobel winners Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson suggests nation fails because their system fails but systems does not change and get better unless the majority change. And majority does not change unless they _study_! And let me emphasize on "study" because wandal reading does not change you or if it does it is not granted for positive change!

On "positive" changing maybe in another project :D

## Ethymological Why
I would like to start with how knoledge is formed and percieved by our nervous system and brain
